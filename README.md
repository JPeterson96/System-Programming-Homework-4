# System-Programming-Homework-4

In this assignment we were tasked with writting methods that can read and write from files, and work with directories. All of this program follows the ANSI and POSIX standards for portibility.

This assignment was assigned on replit which is an online compiler to ensure it would run for us as well as the professor. If there are any problems running it that might be why. 

There was a slight bug in the final method but besides that it runs flawlessly.
